# Repository Reorganization
I am currently reorganizing my repository to improve its structure and make it easier to navigate. During this process, some files and directories may be moved, renamed, or removed. However, all the essential files and functionalities will still be available.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience during this time. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

Igor Pantale√£o
