# Flask Projects Repository
I am currently reorganizing my repository to improve its structure and make it easier to navigate. During this process, I will be separating my Flask projects into separate folders to make it easier to manage and maintain.

Some files and directories may be moved, renamed, or removed. However, all the essential files and functionalities will still be available. The new structure will help me to better organize my code and make it more accessible for others who may want to use or contribute to my projects.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience during this time. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Igor Pantale√£o
